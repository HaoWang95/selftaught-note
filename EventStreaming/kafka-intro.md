# **Kafka**
Kafka combines three key capabilities.
* To publish and subscribe to streams of events, including continuous import/export of the data from other systems.
* To store streams of events durably and reliably for as long as we want
* To process streams of events as they occur or retrospectively.

Kafka is a distributed system consisting of servers and clients that communicae via **tcp** protocol.
