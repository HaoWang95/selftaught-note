# JDK
**Java Development Kit** contains the minimum software you need to do Java development.
> - javac(compiler)
> - java(creates vm and executes the program)
> - jar(archiver, package files together)
> - javadoc(generating documentation)

In previous versions of Java, a **Java Runtime Environment(JRE)** was also bundled with the download and installation of JDK. The JRE was a subset of the JDK that was used for running a program but could not compile one. In Java 11, the JRE is no longer available as a stand-alone download.
