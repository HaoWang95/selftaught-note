## **React Hooks**

By using Hooks, I can use hooks to build features without writing a class.


### Basic hooks
**useState**
**useEffect**
**useContext**

### Advanced hooks
**useReducer**
**useCallback**
**useMemo**
**useRef**
**useImperativeHandle**
**useLayoutEffect**
**useDebugValue**

_Understanding_ these hooks, _knowing how to_ apply these hooks into functional components and being able to _write customized hooks_ are keypoints to be a good frontend dev with React.
