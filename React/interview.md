Good morning everyone,(Thank you so much for doing the interview with me in the earlier morning, really appreciate this opportunity and thank you all for your time) I'm, I'm currently working in Capg as a fullstack developer. My current tech-stack background are Java with Spring Boot and other spring modules, Node.js with Express and React, I'm familiar with using TypeScript in Node.js and React as well. Also I've a basic taste for Flutter.

Two of my previous projects are e-commerce projects in previous roles, which are called sheepo and au-story separetely. As they are both e-commerce apps and austory is more larger than sheepo, I'll mainly talk about the au-story project. I was mainly the backend developer in the austory project, our backend tech stack is Node.js Express.js with TypeScript and sometimes work as a frontend developer as well, our front end techstack is React and the database we were using is Mongodb, SO THIS IS A TYPICALLY A MERN STACK project. This e-commerce project consists of 3 different ends.
* The platform, which is the business owner, they can manage both shop information and help customers to manage the customer information as well(if necessary). The platform admin logs in via the React built portal to check the overral accumulated sales, and manage the information of shops and customers and so on..
* The second side/end is called the shop end. This is when a shop can choose to join the e-commerce platform, manage their shop details and manage the product information, manage the orders created by customers and dispatch parcel delivery request to delivery services.(There are quite lots of 3rd party and partner API integration here)
* Then the third end is the Customer end, this is a Flutter built frontend APP that interact with our node.js API at the backend. This is more about query products, shops, and manage personal information and make purchase and then track their delivery package in the app.

(TypeScript, when we code TypeScript, I think the app is still being execed, built into a JavaScript project, what TypeScript really provides is the static type checking that clearly indicates the type of a data structure)

What would be my daily role/daily activities if I'm considered?
To whom should I report to due to my assigned task? 
To whom should I seek help If I'm having coding issues or software/hardware issues?
