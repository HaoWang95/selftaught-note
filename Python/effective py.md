# **Effective Python**

> - Know the Python version
```Python
import sys

print(sys.version)
```

> - The Zen of Python
    * There should be one-and preferably only one-obvious way to do it.
```Python
import this
```

> - Follow PEP8
> - Know the difference between str and bytes.
    * Bytes instances contain raw, unsigned 8-bit values.
