# Data structure and algorithms

---

This folder contains data structure and algorithm practices. Even though it is now rare to have a direct data structure or algorithm challenge during daily development work(Most concepts tend to be engineering concepts like services, testing, logging and containerization). But practicing data structure and various kinds of algorithms can provide a problem-solving methodology and improve the programming skills in general.

The programming language used to provide some examples will be:
> C++
> JAVA
> GOLANG
> PYTHON
For each problem illustrated, data structure given, I'll try to provide an implementation of each of the languages above to have a better illustration and understanding. 
It might be quite repeatitive to provide examples of different languages. But most languages tend to have their own philosophies in terms of expressing the same idea, therefore, let's see I hope to explore in depth of these ideas by using these languages.
