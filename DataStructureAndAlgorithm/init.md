# Data structure and algorithms

This folder contains data structure and algorithm practices. Even though it is now rare to have a direct data structure or algorithm challenge during daily development work(Most concepts tend to be engineering concepts). But practicing data structure and various kinds of algorithms can provide a problem-solving approach and improve the programming skills in general.

I think this folder will just contain data structure and algorithm notes, and some practices. The main programming language used will be:
> C++
> JAVA
> GOLANG
> PYTHON
I think it is really important to keep separate folders for different programming languages.(Also I need to mention this in the intro)
