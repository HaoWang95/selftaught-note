## Jamstack
Jamstack is a web development architecture that minimizes the day-to-day overhead of maintaining websites by moving the complicated pieces out of run time or by encapsulating them into easier-to-manage services.

Jamstack is heavily reliant on the core web technologies of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers the ability to get up and running on the modern web quickly so we can build websites with outstanding performance, low cost and little maintenance. It provides an approach to web development where most of the website is prebuilt and client-side scripting adds dynamicity.

## Hugo
Hugo is among the most popular of the current Jamstack framework and provides the best build speeds. It helps us perform web development without the annoyances of setup, upkeep, or day-to-day maintenance. There's no waiting for compilation, updates, or deployment. Hugo takes a template and a website in markup format and converts that to HTML, so the entire site is ready to be hosted.
