# IAM
* IAM = Identity and Access Management, global service
* Root account: created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
* Users: people within the organization
* Groups only contain users, not other groups
* Users can belong to multiple groups

## IAM Permissions
* Users or Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies.
* These policies define the permissions of the users.
* Least privilege principle: don't give more permissions than a user needs.
