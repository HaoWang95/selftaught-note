# Overview
Apache Cassandra is a distributed, NoSQL database. It is based on a partitioned wide column storage model with eventually consistent semantics. 
It is initially designed at Facebook using a staged event-driven architecture to implement a combination of Amazon's Dynamo distributed storage and replication techiniques and Google's Bigtable data and storage engine model.

* Keyspace
* Table
* Partition
* Row
* Column
