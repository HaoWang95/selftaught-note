## Interaction styles
* The first dimension is whether the interaction is one-to-one or one-to-many
  * One-to-one, each client request is processed by exactly one service
  * One-to-many, each request is processed by multiple services
* The second dimensions is whether the interaction is synchronous or asynchronous
  * Synchronous, the client expects a timely response from the service and might even block while it waits.
  * Asynchronous, the client doesn't block, and the response, if any, isn't necessarily sent immediately.

### One-to-one interactions
* Request/Response, an interaction style that generally results in services being tightly coupled.
* Asynchronous request/response, the client doesn't block while waiting, because the service might not send the response for a long time.
* One-way notifications, a service client sends a request to a service, but no reply is expected.

### One-to-many interactions
* Publish/subscribe, a client publishes a notification message, which is consumed by 0 or more interested services.
* Publish/async responses, a client publishes a request message and then waits for a certain amount of time for responses from interested services.

## Semantic versioning
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

* MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
* MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
* PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.

## Handling partial failure using the **circuit breaker pattern**
Using **Hystrix** or **Resilience4j**.

## Using service discovery
Service discovery is conceptually simple, its key component is a service registry, which is a database of the network locations of an application's services instances.
### Applying application level service discovery patterns
* Self-registration pattern, a service invokes the service registry's registration API to register its network location
* Client-discovery pattern, when a client wants to invoke a service, it queries the service registry to obtain a list of the services's instances.
>- Eureka is a highly available service registry.
>- One benefit of application-level service discovery is that it handles the scenario when services are deployed on multiple deployment platforms. Imagine, for example, youâ€™ve deployed only some of services on Kubernetes, and the rest is running in a legacy environment. Application-level service discovery using Eureka, for example, works across both environments, whereas Kubernetes-based service discovery only works within Kubernetes.
>- One drawback of application-level service discovery is that a service discovery library for every language(framework) is needed. Spring cloud only helps Spring developers while Node.js or GoLang require other service discovery framework. Another drawback of application-level service discovery is that developers are responsible to set up and manage the service registry, which is a distraction and can be a configuration issue. It's a better option to use a service discovery mechanism that's provided by the deployment infrastructure.
### Applying the platform-provided service discovery patterns
Docker and Kubernetes have a built-in service discovery registry and service discovery mechanism. The deployment platform gives each services a DNS name, a virtual IP address, and a DNS name that resolves to the VIP address. A service client makes a request to the DNS name/VIP, and the deployment platform automatically routes the request to one of the available service instances. Therefore, service registration, service discovery, and request routing are entirely handled by the deployment platform.
* 3rd party registration pattern, instead of a service registering itself with the service registry, a third party called registrar, which is typically part of the deployment platform, handles the registration.
* Service-side discovery pattern, instead of a client querying the service registry, it makes a request to a DNS name, which resolves to a request router that queries the service registry and load balances requests.

## Communicating using asyn messaging pattern
### Channels
* P2P
* Publish-subscribe
A message-based application typically uses a message-broker, an infrastructure service through which the service communicates.
