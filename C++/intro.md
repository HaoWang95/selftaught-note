# C++ Magic
1. C++ is a general-purpose programming language with a bias in system programming. 
2. C++ is a general purpose programming language with providing a direct and efficient model combined with facilities for defining lightweight abstractions.
3. 

## Learning C++
No programming language is perfect. A programming language does not have to be perfect to be a good tool for building great systems. In fact, a general-purpose programming language cannot be perfect for all of the many tasks to which it is put. What is perfect for one task is often seriously flawed for another because perfection in one area implies specification. Thus, C++ was designed to be a good tool for building a wide variaty of systems and allow a wide variety of ideas to be expressed directly. 
Java, compared with C++, is another general-purpose programming language as well. Java has a higher-level of abstraction which means it is not a good choice for system programming. But with the JVM specification, Java community embraces multiple options of JVM implementation which enables the language to run on numerious platforms just like C++. With auto memory management, programmers can focus more on the expressiveness of application logic instead of hardware/data structure usage management. This gives Java a good reputation for quick development.

(Also these two languages are being complained the most after 2015. C++ has very obscured syntax and barely has clear definition of best practices because there can be a numerous way to code for the best practices. For Java, it is criticized for the code redundancy during development. Also, Java has lost many of its ecosystem and has become a main-stream choice of big companies for backend service.)
