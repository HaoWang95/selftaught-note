# Usser-Defined types

## Structures
The first step in building a new type is often to organize the elements it needs into a data structure, which is a struct.
```c++
using namespace std;

// A random struct called Person
struct Person{
    string firstname;
    string lastname;
    int age;
    Address* address; // Pointer to address
}

// Another random struct called vector
struct MyVector{
    int size; //Number of elements
    double* elem; 
}

void vector_init(Vector& v, int size)
// Here, we are going to make some modifications into Vector v, so we must pass in a reference.
{
    v.elem = new double[size];
    v.size = size;
}
```

## Unions
A **union** is a **struct** in which all members are allocated at the same address so that the union occupies only as much space as its largest memeber. Naturally, a union can hold a value for only one member at a time. For example, consider a symbol table entry that holds a name and a value.
```c++
using namespace std;
enum Type {ptr, num};

struct Entry{
    string name; // string type
    Type t;
    Node *p; // use p if t==ptr
    int i; // use i if t == num
    // with the definition above, members p and i are never used at the same time.
}

void f(Entry* entry_ptr){
    if(entry_ptr->t==num){
        cout<< entry_ptr->i<< endl; 
    }else{
        cout<< entry_ptr->p<< endl;
    }
}
```
The code snippet above, members p and i are never used at the same time, so space is wasted. It can be easily recovered by specifying that both should be members of a union.
```c++
union Value{
    Node *p;
    int i;
}

// now the struct Entry can be refactored as
struct Entry{
    string name;
    Type t;
    Value v; // use v.p if t==ptr, use v.i if t==num;
}

void f(Entry* entry){
    if(entry->t == ptr){
        cout << entry->v.p<<endl;
    }else{
        cout << entry->v.t<<endl;
    }
}
```
The standard library type, **variant** can be used to elimate most directt usage of unions. For example **variant<Node*, int>** means it holds either a Node* or an int.
```c++
struct Entry{
    string name;
    variant<Node*, int> v;
}

void f(Entry* entry){
    if(holds_alternative<int>(entry->v)){
        // do something here
    }
    if(holds_alternative<Node*>(entry->v)){
        // do something here
    }
}
```
## Enumerations
```c++
enum class Color{red, blue, green};
enum class Traffic_light{green, yellow, red};
Color col = Color::red;
Traffic_light traffic_light = Traffic_light::green;
```
