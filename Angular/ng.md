# **Angular**

To understand and use Angular,
* **Components**
* **Templates**
* **Directives**
* **Dependency injection**
learn about the concepts above. By following the get started tutorial in the Angular documentation, it is relatively easy to have a basic understanding of the above concepts.

## **Components**
## **Templates**
## **Directives**
## **Dependency injection**
Dependency injection, or DI, is a design pattern in which a class requests dependencies from external resources rather than creating them.

### **<router-outlet>**
This is a feature of the routing lib. Replace the content as the app navigates to a different route.
