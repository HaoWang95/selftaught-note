A separated config server can be implemented with spring cloud config dependencies.
The main purpose of using a spring cloud config is to separate configuration settings from all running instances of microservices. For each microservices(it can be 10 or 1000 instances of microservices), the configuration information for these services can be managed in a single config service instance and be loaded/refreshed at run time.
